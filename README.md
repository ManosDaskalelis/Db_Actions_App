# Db actions app

Db_Actions_App is a C# application that simplifies interacting with databases by enabling users to write connection strings, search for tables, and execute queries across multiple tables. This tool makes it easy to perform actions like querying, searching, and running custom SQL commands on a variety of database systems.
Additionally, the app prints the queries in the console and saves them to a text file for easier reading and reference


## Features ðŸ’¡

- Connection String Setup: Easily configure your database connection by writing the connection string in the app.config file.
- Table Search: Input the name of a database table, and the app will search for it on the server.
- Multiple Table Query Execution: If the specified table is found in more than one location, the app allows you to run your custom SQL query on all matching tables.
- Flexible SQL Query: Execute any SQL query you provide, targeting multiple tables at once, to perform bulk operations.
- Console Output: The app prints the executed queries directly in the console, so you can see what is being run in real-time.
